Created for social enjoyment during the FIFA World Cup group stage, this MVC-patterned application enables friends to predict match outcomes. The administrator can add matches, while users engage in predictions. Once a match commences, user predictions are locked. Upon inputting final results, the application calculates points for each user based on accurately predicted outcomes or match winners.
